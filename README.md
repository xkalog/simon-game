# simon-game
A simple popular game I have implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.

How long a sequence can you remember?

Play this simon game and have fun testing your memory. 
Follow the pattern of lights and sounds and repeat the same combination to move on to the next level.

It starts off easy but it won’t be long before you’re questioning your memory and struggling to remember the pattern. Rack up high scores, improve your memory and enjoy this classic game.
